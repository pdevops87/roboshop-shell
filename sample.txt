this is a sample

BASEOS
APPSTREAM



sed '/^bind/ s/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/'

to change complete line
sed '/protected-mode/ c /protected-mode no' | grep protected-no  /etc,

ss -lntp, to open ports


sudo sed -i '/^bind/ s/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/' | sudo grep ^bind  /etc/redis/redis.conf


colors:
------
RGYBMC
Red-31
Green-32
Yellow-33
Blue-34
Magenta-35
Cyan-36
echo -e \\e[31mHello World; hello ;;;; prints both text in red color
to apply the color for the firs text use \\e[0m
echo -e \\e[31mHello World\\e[0m; Hrllo,  here -e is for enable the text ,\\e to enable the color


echo $PS1
ls -l /boot 1>/tmp/out 2>/tmp/out, here 1 is to display an output and 2 is an error to redirect output to /tmp/out
ls -l /boot >/tmp/out 2>/tmp/out, this and above command both are same
to keep both output and error use the below command:
ls -l /boot &>/tmp/out, here &> is both for output and an error
ls -l /boot 1>/tmp/out 2>&1, to append error in /tmp/out
cat <file.txt means to read the content from file.txt and display by cat command
syntax: command <filename , input redirects works for only commands
take output from the command and store it into a file use >stdout(/tmp/out)
sometimes we don't want to store data into a disk at that time we use &>/dev/null
ls &>/dev/null
how do we know whether the command executes properly or not?
use exit status
echo $? -0 success other than failure
